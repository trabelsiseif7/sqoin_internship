      " Blockchain is a decentralised, immutable record of economic activity that may be used to record nearly any exchange of value, not just money.  A Blockchain is a continuously expanding digital ledger that maintains an unalterable, secure record of all transactions that have ever occurred. Simply described, it is an immutable distributed database that is administered by a group of computers but is not owned by any one organisation. Blockchain data is kept as flat files or databases. Without the need for a third-party middleman like a bank or the government, it may be used for the secure transfer of money, property, contracts, etc. \n"
